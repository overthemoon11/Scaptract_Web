## Helpful Hints 

### A. References 

List and number all references at the end of the paper. When referring to them in the text, type the corresponding reference number in square brackets as shown at the end of this sentence[1]. Number the citations consecutively. The sentence punctuation follows the brackets. Do not use "Ref. [3]" or "reference [3" except at the beginning of a sentence.

Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at the bottom of the column in which it is cited.Do not put footmotes in the reference list.



Give all authors' names; do not use "et al" unless there are six authors or more. Papers that have not been published,even if they have been submitted for publication, should be cited as "unpublished"[4]. Papers that have been accepted for publication should be cited as "in press"[5]. Capitalize only the first word in paper title, except for proper nouns and element symbols.



For papers published in translated journals, please give the English citation first, followed by the original foreignlanguage citations [6]



### B.Abbreviations and Acronyms 

Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used. Acronyms such as MOSFET, ac and dc do not have to be defined. Redefine acronyms when first used in the text even if they have been defined in the abstract.



### C. Equations 

Number equations consecutively with equation numbers in parentheses flush with the right margin, as in (1).To make your equations more compact, you may use the solidus (/),the exp function, or appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, but not Greek symbols.Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus sign. Use parentheses to avoid ambiguities in denominators. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a sentence, like this,

$$\begin{align*}\int_{0}^{r_{2}}&F(r,\mathbf{m})dr dr\mathbf{m}=\left\|\mathbf{g}_{r_{2}}\mid(2\mathbf{p}_{0})\right\|\\\downarrow&\int_{0}^{\infty}\exp^{(-\mathbf{m})}\left|z_{j}-z_{1}\right|\left|\mathbf{g}^{-1}J_{1}(\mathbf{m}r_{2})J_{0}(\mathbf{m}r_{1})d\mathbf{m}\right|\end{align*}$$

Be sure that the symbols in your equation have been defined before the equation appears or immediately following. When you refer to equations in the text, refer to (1). Do not use $ ``\mathrm{Eq}$ $(1)$ or "Equation $(1)$ except at the beginning of a sentence:"Equation (1) is used…."

### D. Other Recommendations 

Use either one or two spaces between sections, and between text and tables or figures, to manipulate the column length.Use two spaces after periods at the end of sentences (full stops).

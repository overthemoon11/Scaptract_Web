Abstract: Stllarmagnetiactivity,manifestdthrough spotsaculaeandars),undamentallyshapes the exoplanets' environments. For low-mass stars in particular, where most habitable-zone planets reside,the variable magnetic phenomena can dominate atmospheric chemistry, surface radiation levels, long-term atmospheric escape, and ultimately habitability. However, physical characteristics of these transients (e.g.energy and temperature) and their spectra remain ill-constrained due to limitations in cadence and magnitude access of current spectroscopic facilities. A next-generation 12-m class ground-based observatory equipped with integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) and multi-object spectroscopy (MoS) at R~4,000 and ~40,000 offers a transformational opportunity to characterize stellar activity in the time domain across large samples of exoplanet host stars. Such a facility would enable simultaneous monitoring of continuum variability, chromospheric and coronal line diagnostics, and particle-accelerated flare signatures, resolving the physics driving space weather and quantifying its impact on planetary atmospheres.
1. Science Drivers 
The classical habitable zone framework assumes relatively stable insolation, yet the radiation and particle injection from stellar magnetic activity can dominate the atmospheric evolution of close-in terrestrial worlds. Activestars,particulalyM dwarfs,exhibitrequntares withenergies spanning $10^{\mathrm{30}}{-}10^{\mathrm{35}}$ erg,orders of magnitude higher than solar analogs on a per-unit-luminosity basis. These events generate impulsive UV/blue continuum enhancements, strong Balmer-series emission, and high-energy particle fluxes capable of altering ozone and NOx/HOx chemistry,driving atmospheric escape through enhanced ionization, increasing surface UV-C irradiation levels, modulating cloud formation and photochemistry,and producing prebiotic precursor molecules under specific conditions (Berger et al. 2024).Thenetimpactiuncai:ae maybehazardouatlio l,depndinoquncy,spctral energy distribution(Ds),ndcontxtulnvometalactorsRimmertal218;Tllytl.209.To determine which regimes promote or suppress habitability, we require time-resolved spectroscopy that captures both the transient continuum slopes and the rich line forest associated with chromospheric heating, with sufficient cadence to track impulsive rise phases lasting seconds to minutes.Stellar magnetic activity can significantly infuence the dynamics that may lead to the engulfment of planets. Stellar magnetic activity can lead to tidal forces that might cause the planetto lose orbital stability overtime.Thiscanladtoscenarios whereaplanet spialsinward andeventuallygtsenguledbyte star (Gehan 2025).For stars withhigh maneticactivity,magneticbrakingcan slow down therotationof the star. This can alter the stellar wind and the magnetic environment around the star, impacting the stability of nearby planets (Matt & Pudritz 2005). Magnetic interactions can also affect planetary migration patterns,potentially leading to collisions or absorption by the star if a planet's orbit decays sufficiently (Nelson &Papaloizou 2004). Further detailed studies are necessary to fully understand the mechanisms involved.Space-based missions (Kepler, TESS) have provided broadband photometric flare catalogs, yet they lack spectroscopic diagnostics needed to determine temperatures, densities, energies, and particle fluxes.Current ground-based facilities offer limited sample size, sensitivity, or cadence, particularly for fainter M dwarfs and for high-resolution spectroscopic coverage of large stellar populations. A 12-m class facility dedicated to time-domain astronomy and monitoring large areas of the sky can provide order-of-magnitude improvements in temporal coverage, sensitivity, and diagnostic richness like never before.The combination of aperture, multiplexing, and spectral resolution is uniquely suited to deliver flare I)SEDs from 350–2000 nm at high signal-to-noise, revealing the Balmer and Paschen continua, blackbody components, and radiative backwarming; II) Velocity-resolved chromospheric line diagnostics (e., Hα,Ca ⅡI H&K, He I 1083 nm) with R~40,000 for measuring mass motions, turbulence, and reconnection-driven evaporation; III) Population-level flare rates and energies across hundreds of exoplanet hosts; IV) Spot and faculae evolution through line-profile tomography, enabling improved stellar

### 2. Synergies with other facilities 

A 12-m class ground-based facility with high-cadence operational for multiple years, equipped with IFS and MOS provides essential time-domain and spectroscopic context for the next generation of exoplanet missions. These missions increasingly confront the limitations imposed by stellar activity(spots, faculae,and especially flares) which imprint spectral and photometric signatures at or above the precision levels required for atmospheric characterization. Continuous,multi-wavelength,high-resolution monitoring from the ground enables calibration, validation, and enhancement of space-based exoplanet science across several key missions. The synergy between different facilities addresses the transformative concepts outlined below:

### 1. Transforming Atmospheric Characterization through Stellar Context 

Atmospheric measurements from Ariel, JwST, Roman, and ultimately HWO demand exquisite correction for stellar contamination. Without contemporaneous knowledge of flare activity, spot/faculae evolution, or chromospheric state,transmission and emission spectra can be fundamentally misinterpreted.This synergy elevates space-based atmospheric retrievals from descriptiveto physically interpretable,ensuringreliable

These synergies allow demographic studies of space weather in the Galactic context, which no mission can achieve alone.



### 3. Delivering Predictive Stellar Space-Weather Models for Habitable Planet Searches 

The search for life (especially with HWO, but also with JWST and Ariel) requires understanding whether exoplanet atmospheres can persist under real stellar irradiation and particle conditions (Berger et al. 2024);e.g. assessing exoplanethabitability requires direct spectroscopic characterization of the sellar environments that shape atmospheric survival.

### 3. Key Questions 

Here are the major open questions that the next big telescope developed by ESO will address through conducting a decadal spectroscopic survey of young, active exoplanet hosts:

(I) How do flare and spot activity translate into atmospheric escape and photochemistry on exoplanets?(II) How do chromospheric and coronal plasma dynamics evolve in real time during transient magnetic events, and what do these dynamics reveal about mass motions, magnetic topology, and particle injection relevant for planetary atmospheric loss?



(III) What are the fundamental physical mechanisms that trigger and power the most energetic stellar flares across various stellar spectral types, and how do they reshape exoplanetary environments on timescales from seconds to gigayears?



(IV) How do spots and faculae evolve, and how do they bias exoplanet measurements?

(V) How do these events influence protoplanetary chemistry, ionization structure, and the early atmospheric evolution of close-in forming planets?



(VI) How does the full-time-resolved SEDs of stellar flares (homogeneously from the optical to the NIR regime) control the photochemical trajectories and long-term habitability of exoplanet atmospheres? Can life survive or even originate within the intense, spectrally complex flare environment of common M dwarfs?



(VII) Under whatconditions does stellar manetic activity transition from atmospheric destroyer to chemicalcatalyst for prbiotic molecules,and which sars representthe most promising targets for biosignature searches?

## Technical Requirements 

Ideally, to meet our science goals the spectroscopic facility will meet the following requirements:

(II) Spectral Resolution: A) Low-res $(\mathbb{R}{\sim}4,000)$  IFS mode for capturing SED evolution, broad features,and continuum slopes. B) Low- and high-res R~40,00) MOS modes for chromospheric lines, velocity fields, and detailed line diagnostics.



(III) Wavelength Coverage: 350–2000 nm, with simultaneous optical + NIR channels preferred. Must include Hα, Hβ, CaII H&K, CaII IR triplet, He I 5876 & 1083 nm, FeII multiplets, continuum windows around Balmer/Paschen jumps.

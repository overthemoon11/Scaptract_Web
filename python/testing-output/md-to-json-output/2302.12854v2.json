        "content": "Ideas and conversations often arise in research settings in response to problems, gaps, or issues. But some ideas and conversations also come about in a more generative fashion: they are still responding to something within a context but are not concerned with problems and gaps.So, whether filling gaps or otherwise, a micro-paper (and even the authors at times) must clearly and reflexively be situated within a conversational context.\n\nAt a meta-level, this paper is framed as a gapfiller (see: Fig 1). Currently, academic publishing is expensive, time-consuming, and high risk. And while much of the process could be argued as a necessary set of procedures to ensure we aren't making claims that are misleading or unfounded, there exists a gap for disseminating ideas that should be cheap, accessible,and intended to inspire other work [4]. Not all research conversation needs to have answers. The heart of research as a community is due to the dissemination of ideas that aren't only congealed or refined, but raw and messy as well.\n\n\n\nGenerally, the gap for disseminating cheap ideas is filled by academics today through Twitter,blogging, or in some form of social media or another.Sometimes the gap is filled through workshops,position papers, or conversation pieces (such as ACM's Interactions). There are many options for sharing ideas,all with different tradeoffs between editorial and authoring expenses, time, archiving, accessibility, and democratization of the process.\n\n\n\n3.A micro-paper's goal is the free, cheap,open, and honest dissemination of ideas The micro-paper's focus is on ideas for the sake of generative work, conversation, and inspiration. In contrast, a micro-paper is not an appropriate venue for sharing findings, claims, or experiments. The nature of methodological generation of knowledge is most trustworthy when there is a more rigorous process in place. Some avenues generate good or trustworthy knowledge and ideas, but the micro-paper is a place for sharing potentially useful ideas. Good or trustworthy knowledge may require more careful review [3, 4, 6],but potentially useful ideas should at least be archived."
